# IQ-Number-Test-Solver
This modular python package is an IQ-Number Test solver.
It increases the state of the arts (2020) performance on short IQ-Number Test sequences.
Additionally, it can solve for any position of a given IQ-Number Test sequence in contrast to only the last position.

To alter the tests made in the search structure, please add tests to the ..._test.py files.
Testingground.ipyn should give an overfiew over my project.
